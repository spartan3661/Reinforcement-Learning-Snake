# Simple Agent to Play Python (v1)

## Overview
This repository contains a simple reinforcement learning agent trained to play a basic game of snake. 
While the agent is not very good, it only seems to avoid dying, the goal of this initial version was simply to get an agent up and running, no matter the level of performance.

## Project Goals
- Version 1 Goal: Create a functioning agent capable of playing the game in some capacity.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/spartan3661/Reinforcement-Learning-Snake.git
2. Install dependencies
   '''sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Install pytorch with cuda

## Usage
1. Run train_stablebaselines3.py
2. Run play.py

## Future Plans
- Improve agent performance and make the agent more aggressive in seeking fruits
- Try different models, reward fucntions and hyperparameters
